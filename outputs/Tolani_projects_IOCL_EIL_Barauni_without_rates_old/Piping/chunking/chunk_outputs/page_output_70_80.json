The identification marks of the piping and joints shall be noted before blasting and the same shall be transferred on primed surface with Polyurethane paint (F2) or as per the instructions of Engineer-in-Charge. Notes: 1. All joints (fabrication  as well as erection joints) shall be left unpainted till hydrotesting.  2. No extra payment shall be made for identification (line numbering etc.) of insulated and uninsulated lines.",
